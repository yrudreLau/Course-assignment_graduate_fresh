Breast cancer prediciton with single hidden layer Neural Netwrx.
There are .ipynb, three .py files and some figures (for explanation in .ipynb file), the .ipynb file have some description of modelling process, if you want to use these models directly, just need to download .py files and code in the test.py, after importing and running neural netwx model with different activation functions, gradient descent patterns, you can get and save the results for the following analysis.
